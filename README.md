# Gun Upgrader
## This game was originally planned to be made for TriJam #166 on itch.io, however, due to development time and a deadline on submitting the game, I was unable to submit for the game jam, but I still decided to finish the project. To make this project, I used Unity 3D and C#.

# Description
## Gun Upgrader was made with the theme of "Upgrade the Weapons", a simple incremental game with the gameplay loop being to shoot enemies to earn money and use that money to upgrade the damage and fire rate of your weapon, with different weapons being unlocked for purchase when a certain number of damage and fire rate upgrades have been purchased.

# Controls
## Mouse to aim
